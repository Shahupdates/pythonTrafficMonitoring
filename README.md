# Recommendation System

This is a recommendation system that utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to generate personalized recommendations for users. It follows a multi-step process to gather user data, implement machine learning algorithms, develop the recommendation system, test and evaluate its performance, document the development process, and showcase the project.

## Steps

1. **Gather and preprocess user data**: The system collects data from various sources, cleans it by removing missing values and duplicates, and performs feature engineering to create relevant features for analysis.

2. **Implement machine learning algorithms**: The data is split into training and testing sets. Collaborative filtering and content-based filtering models are created, and a hybrid filtering model is developed by combining both approaches.

3. **Develop a recommendation system**: A function is created that takes user data as input and generates recommendations using the hybrid filtering model. The function returns the top 5 recommendations.

4. **Test and evaluate the system**: Cross-validation is used to evaluate the system's performance by calculating the mean cross-validation score. A/B testing is performed to evaluate the system's effectiveness by comparing the conversion rates of recommendation groups.

5. **Document the development process**: Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab is used to document the code and analysis. Clear and concise instructions are provided for using the recommendation system. Explanations are included for the data sources, preprocessing steps, machine learning algorithms used, and evaluation metrics.

6. **Showcase the project**: A portfolio or GitHub repository is created to showcase the recommendation system. Examples are provided to demonstrate how the system provides value to users, such as increasing conversion rates or improving customer satisfaction. The key features and benefits of the recommendation system, such as its accuracy and personalization capabilities, are highlighted.

## Example Usage

```python
user_data = {'age_in_days': 10000, 'is_male': 1, 'product_interest': 'books'}
recommendations = recommend(pd.DataFrame(user_data, index=[0]))
print(recommendations)
```

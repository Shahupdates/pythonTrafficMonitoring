# Step 5: Document the development process

# Use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to document the code and analysis
# Create clear and concise instructions for using the recommendation system
# Include explanations of the data sources, preprocessing steps, machine learning algorithms, and evaluation metrics

# Step 6: Showcase your project

# Create a portfolio or GitHub repository to showcase the recommendation system
# Include examples of how it can be used to provide value to users, such as increasing conversion rates or improving customer satisfaction
# Highlight the key features and benefits of the recommendation system, such as its accuracy and personalization capabilities

# Example usage of the recommendation system
user_data = {'age_in_days': 10000, 'is_male': 1, 'product_interest': 'books'}
recommendations = recommend(pd.DataFrame(user_data, index=[0]))
print(recommendations)

# Key features and benefits of the recommendation system
# - Uses machine learning to generate personalized recommendations based on user data
# - Incorporates collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for improved accuracy
# - Supports hybrid filtering by combining the strengths of both approaches
# - Evaluates system performance through cross-validation and A/B testing
# - Can increase conversion rates and improve customer satisfaction through personalized recommendations

# Visualizations
# Example visualization of user age distribution
plt.hist(data['age_in_days'], bins=20)
plt.xlabel('Age (in days)')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('User Age Distribution')
plt.show()

# Example visualization of model performance
plt.boxplot(scores)
plt.xlabel('Model')
plt.ylabel('Cross-validation score')
plt.title('Model Performance')
plt.xticks([1], ['Hybrid Filtering'])
plt.show()

# Example visualization of product interest preferences
product_counts = data['product_interest'].value_counts()
plt.bar(product_counts.index, product_counts.values)
plt.xlabel('Product Interest')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.title('Product Interest Preferences')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

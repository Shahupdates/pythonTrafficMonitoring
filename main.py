import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
import numpy as np

# Step 1: Gather and preprocess user data

# Collect data from various sources
data = pd.read_csv('user_data.csv')

# Clean the data
data = data.dropna()
data = data.drop_duplicates()

# Perform feature engineering
data['age_in_days'] = (pd.to_datetime('today') - pd.to_datetime(data['birth_date'])).dt.days
data['is_male'] = (data['gender'] == 'male').astype(int)

# Prepare data for analysis
X = data[['age_in_days', 'is_male', 'product_interest']]
y = data['purchase_history']


# Step 2: Implement machine learning algorithms

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create a collaborative filtering model
cf_model = CollaborativeFiltering()
cf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create a content-based filtering model
cb_model = ContentBasedFiltering()
cb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Create a hybrid filtering model
hybrid_model = HybridFiltering(cf_model, cb_model)
hybrid_model.fit(X_train, y_train)


# Step 3: Develop a recommendation system

# Create a function that takes user data as input and generates recommendations
def recommend(user_data):
    # Use the hybrid filtering model to generate recommendations
    recommendations = hybrid_model.predict(user_data)
    
    # Return the top 5 recommendations
    return recommendations.head(5)


# Step 4: Test and evaluate the system

# Use cross-validation to evaluate the system's performance
scores = cross_val_score(hybrid_model, X, y, cv=5)
print(f"Mean cross-validation score: {np.mean(scores)}")

# Use A/B testing to evaluate the system's effectiveness
test_data = pd.read_csv('test_data.csv')
group_a = test_data[test_data['group'] == 'A']
group_b = test_data[test_data['group'] == 'B']

group_a_recs = group_a.apply(recommend, axis=1)
group_b_recs = group_b.apply(recommend, axis=1)

group_a_ctr = group_a_recs.apply(lambda x: len(set(x) & set(group_a['purchase_history'])) / len(x))
group_b_ctr = group_b_recs.apply(lambda x: len(set(x) & set(group_b['purchase_history'])) / len(x))

print(f"Group A conversion rate: {np.mean(group_a_ctr)}")
print(f"Group B conversion rate: {np.mean(group_b_ctr)}")


# Step 5: Document the development process

# Use Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to document the code and analysis
# Create clear and concise instructions for using the recommendation system
# Include explanations of the data sources, preprocessing steps, machine learning algorithms, and evaluation metrics

# Step 6: Showcase your project

# Create a portfolio or GitHub repository to showcase the recommendation system
# Include examples of how it can be used to provide value to users, such as increasing conversion rates or improving customer satisfaction
# Highlight the key features and benefits of the recommendation system, such as its accuracy and personalization capabilities

# Example usage of the recommendation system
user_data = {'age_in_days': 10000, 'is_male': 1, 'product_interest': 'books'}
recommendations = recommend(pd.DataFrame(user_data, index=[0]))
print(recommendations)

# Key features and benefits of the recommendation system
# - Uses machine learning to generate personalized recommendations based on user data
# - Incorporates collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for improved accuracy
# - Supports hybrid filtering by combining the strengths of both approaches
# - Evaluates system performance through cross-validation and A/B testing
# - Can increase conversion rates and improve customer satisfaction through personalized recommendations
